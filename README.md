# React Native IMDB APP


This project aims to be an IMDB MVP for react-native applications. It provides a clear and organized structure, core dependencies, and boilerplate to jumpstart development.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 14](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Recommended: Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)
- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
- [Cocoapods 1.10.1](https://cocoapods.org)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Splash screen customization

To customize the splash screen (logo and background color) use the CLI provided in the [official docs](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash#assets-generation).

## Setup environments

### Using scripts from console

The app already has scripts to execute the project.

To define which platform you want to run, just keep the structure `yarn [platform]`


RUN: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

Also, you can use npm following the same rule as before: `npm run ios`


#### Android

A map associating builds with env files is already defined in `app/build.gradle` you can modify or add environments if needed.

For multiple enviroments to work you would need to change `-keep class [YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME].BuildConfig { *; }` on `proguard-rules.pro` file.

#### iOS

The basic idea in iOS is to have one scheme per environment file, so you can easily alternate between them.

To create a new scheme:

- In the Xcode menu, go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
- Click Duplicate Scheme on the bottom
- Give it a proper name on the top left. For instance: "qa"
- Then edit the newly created scheme to make it use a different env file. From the same "manage scheme" window:

  Expand the "Build" tab on the left menu
  - Click "Pre-actions", and under the plus sign select "New Run Script Action"
  - Where it says "Type a script or drag a script file", type: `echo ".env.qa" > /tmp/envfile` replacing `.env.qa` with your file.
- Also, you will need to select the executable for the new schema:

  Expand the "Run" tab on the left menu
  - Under the "Executable" dropdown select the ".app" you would like to use for that schema

## Generate production version

These are the steps to generate `.apk`, `.aab` and `.ipa` files

### Android

1. Generate an upload key
2. Setting up gradle variables
3. Go to the android folder
4. Execute `./gradlew assemble[Env][BuildType]`

Note: You have three options to execute the project
`assemble:` Generates an apk that you can share with others.
`install:` When you want to test a release build on a connected device.
`bundle:` When you are uploading the app to the Play Store.

### iOS

1. Go to the Xcode
2. Select the schema
3. Select 'Any iOS device' as target
4. Product -> Archive
